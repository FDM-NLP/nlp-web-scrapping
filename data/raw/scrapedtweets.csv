Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

We can see that Greenlane Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company‚Äôs stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it.‚Äù

The proposal values MDC common shares at $4.25/share on a fully diluted basis and implies a premium of 263% to MDC‚Äôs closing price of $1.17/share on June 24.

Stagwell would receive 335.5M common shares of MDC.

The combination will strengthen MDC Partners‚Äô balance sheet and credit profile.

Since these markets are such a psychological game, it's important to have many different personalities under observation.. including your own!

I love the ability to follow people because everyone has something different to say, and if you pick just a handful of people and learn their psychology, it can help be yet another tool to help feel out the market and make trade decisions...

Might seem a little ""stalkerish"" but not at all. I just click ""follow"" on people that stand out to me, and before I know it, after reading lots of their posts, I start to develop an idea of the type of trader they are... and I take note of it all on the daily as part of my DD/daily analysis. 

@diagio is my dynamic thunderbird, he's smart and witty.. quick to drop a hot potato, ruthless, and will call you out for being a bad trader.
@risksavage_inthemarket he's my feisty cannabis man, he will bite your head off and wouldn't be surprised if $SPY went to $0 tomorrow.

MP93,/MP93/message/226632146,Bullish,"$SPY Someone just asked me why I keep saying $308. Look no further than the weekly chart. You have a clear ""Bullish Engulfing"" candle and now the price should come back and tap that $308 price imbalance to setup for a move higher next week. Simple as that. Sure they can sell next week's candle off on the back side of the ""bullish engulfing"" which is called a ""breaker block."" However, I think the more likely move is to confirm that the ""bullish engulfing"" is legit and go with what you're seeing rather than taking a contrarian viewpoint. But that said if they do sell next week's candle off then you'd want to watch that psychological $300 level. Period. Bears if they want to go lower they have to cleanly break through $300 again confirming a ""Bearish Engulfing."" Still too much Fed intervention I don't see it happening yet until SPY seeing ATHs.

Bounce off of the 1 hour 21 and continuation into the third hour of trading.  You can see how the current hourly candle wicked down and got bought up quickly.  That speaks to the strength of the buying right now.   The full range has already been played today as of this morning.  A break of 316 going into the weekend would be pretty bullish.

The little guys have already gotten run over for the last 30 years since Reagan and nothing is changing. They have the strength to weather this. That's why biggest caps are doing best as well, they have been preparing 12 years for this.

It is said the number one reason for business failure is undercapitalized, this is false, it's because they don't have the sales, and can't transform to generate the sales.

Yet, now, the U.S. government has racked up $863 billion in debt, in just one month. 
 
For additional perspective, the budget deficit for June 2019 was $8 billion.  Hence, the deficit for June 2020 has increased 101x compared to June of last year.  This, no doubt, is game over spending; desperate actions by a desperate government to keep this sucker from going down. 
 
Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital, for clarification of what‚Äôs at stake: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a risk that the dollar starts to reverse into a significant downtrend because the value of the dollar versus other currencies is greatly affected by the growth in our budget and trade deficit.‚Äù

But I disagree with this on one fact.  The American Radical Aristocratic Left is more racist.  Even worse, they are passive aggressive and manipulative about it.  At least most Chinese will tell you to their face they think anyone other than Chinese is inferior to them and China gonna rule the world.

Global Fascist Left is most racist.  Telling black people/ ""Minorities"" they need special help to succeed is as racist as it gets.  All the while creating modern day plantations of single mothers and desolate atmosphere where kids are manipulated into believing they have no future because of the Republicans that have never had any say on any policies in their cities.

Left has controlled these cities for Decades and in some cases, centuries. Yet some how its #MAGA , Trump and Republicans fault lol.

Should yield curve control go global, it would cement markets‚Äô perception of central banks as the buyers of last resort, boosting risk appetite, lowering volatility and intensifying a broader hunt for yield. While money managers caution that such an environment could fuel reckless investment already stoked by a flood of fiscal and monetary stimulus, they nonetheless see benefits rippling across credit, equities, gold and emerging markets.

‚ÄúIt depends on the form and the price but broadly speaking it‚Äôs the green light to carry on with the QE trade -- buy everything regardless of valuation,‚Äù said James Athey, who manages $3.1 billion at Aberdeen Standard Investments in London.

MP93,/MP93/message/226987309,Bullish,"$SPY Options are such a great way to grow a SMALL (under $25000) trading account. So long as you‚Äôre trading intraday the nearest expiration option or maybe the next to nearest expiration option you have the ability to swing that contract for well over 100%+ / per Day. I want to put up a chart illustrating how at certain times of the day if you entered a particular option and yes lately it has been calls shortly after the 9:30-10:30am dip and ride those calls throughout the mid portion of the cash session you could capture 100%+ gains in a single trading session. That is how you can turn a SMALL account into $25000+ in a relatively short amount of time. Now, personally I have strict rules to my trading in terms of risk/reward, stops, and profit targets. I typically will risk SPY $0.50 or -10% on my option to make 20-40%. So my risk / reward ratios are always 1 : 2 or 1 : 4.

The initial theorem was that this was an accumulation cycle with a retouch on top of the breakout and turns out we were right.

Nothing shows this better than the daily. With a clear breakout from the chop and a retouch of 3105 which was top of the breakout where new demand would have to be for this to keep going, ES looks as bullish as ever. The 3180 level and of course the 3230 above are clear targets however should ES push through I don‚Äôt think either one of those levels have enough selling interest leftover to stop it. On a pullback some obvious levels to watch out for are 3150 area and 3130 area on a pullback. Until 3230 gets taken out this is still a higher low so do keep that in mind as well.

Clearly TRUMP'S fault, but already factored in. Probably good for 200 points on the DJIA tomorrow.  

Meanwhile, if you really support BLM, check out: 1) MLK (the man), and 2) GLYC (trials with 94.5% black representation, 91% institutional ownership, sub $175M market cap, and pipeline including 2 phase 3 drugs... one of which apparently just proved statistical significance).

Another member of the coronavirus task force, Admiral Brett Giroir, added to the Fauci pile-on today when he told NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeet the Press‚Äù that Fauci has not always been correct.

‚ÄúI respect Dr. Fauci a lot, but Dr. Fauci is not 100 percent right and he also doesn‚Äôt necessarily, he admits that, have the whole national interest in mind. He looks at it from a very narrow public health point of view,‚Äù Giroir said.

‚ÄúThe economic implications of the second wave are pretty clear, qualitatively at least. The third quarter recovery will be slower than we previous expected, but we're hoping that some of the deferred spending will be pushed into the fourth quarter rather than abandoned altogether,‚Äù Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note.

‚ÄúMarkets are caught in the middle. We have argued for months that a full recovery depends on three pillars, namely, sustained progress against the virus, the continuance of super-accommodative Fed policy, and consistent support from fiscal policy,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúClearly, the first pillar has crumbled, and the third is now in limbo, with the Senate in recess until July 20. The Fed can't do everything, so we're not surprised that the S&P 500 has been range-bound since late May.‚Äù",2020/07/13,01:30:13

Everyone will outperform a pathetic guidance and Wall Street will cheer it on. When banks lose 30% YTD it will be a massive buying opportunity because they didn‚Äôt lose 50% ....

This definitely has the potential to retest the 320 area later today and multiple times this week.  Seems like the buying is dying out a bit around 322 which is normal.  I am going to watch to see how the market reacts when spy comes back into the 319-321 range.   I expect to see strong buying.

In recent years, they've gone mainstream, attracting big-name underwriters and investors and raising a record amount of IPO money in 2019.‚Äù

4:05pm  -  I have decided to hold all 5 open positions overnight, including those $SPY calls.  I'm stepping out for a while, but will likely post some updates after 6pm ET.  I expect futures to be increasingly bullish overnight, with either a significant Gap Higher or an overall bullish day tomorrow (either scenario would fulfill the Buy Signals on my XXmin charts as of today's close).

3:58pm  -  Charts look really bullish, especially up around the XXmin time frame.

Economists expect U.S. economic growth contracted at its steepest pace in the second quarter since the Great Depression and original hopes of a swift economic bounce back have been dashed as the United States continues to struggle to contain the virus, almost five months after the first case was reported on U.S. soil.

Fed officials on Tuesday warned of ""thick fog"" ahead for the economy as they continued to reset expectations on the pace of recovery amid fears that a broad second wave of cases could causes unemployment to rise again.

Poor bears. We didn't get the sub 27 VIX that i had hoped for, but today was another big day nonetheless (hopefully for everybody). Today we added +25% NAV to the trading account since inception on 6/1.

Me: Harvard grad and full time portfolio manager and trader w/ 10+ yrs exp. I retired from my full time gig after paying off all of my UG/Grad loans at 31 from trading and investing income. I funded a $40k account with the intention of showing people how they could earn extra income and potentially retire early through learning how to trade properly too. I also post all of my trades so there isn't any bullshit. 

I will be sending out another sentiment report reviewing the option and volatility data this evening. If you want to subscribe to the free weekly and daily reports you can find my email listed on my account.

Poor bears. We didn't get the sub 27 VIX that i had hoped for, but today was another big day nonetheless (hopefully for everybody). Today we added +25% NAV to the trading account since inception on 6/1.

Me: Harvard grad and full time portfolio manager and trader w/ 10+ yrs exp. I retired from my full time gig after paying off all of my UG/Grad loans at 31 from trading and investing income. I funded a $40k account with the intention of showing people how they could earn extra income and potentially retire early through learning how to trade properly too. I also post all of my trades so there isn't any bullshit.

Me: Harvard grad and full time portfolio manager and trader w/ 10+ yrs exp. I retired from my full time gig after paying off all of my UG/Grad loans at 31 from trading and investing income. I funded a $40k account with the intention of showing people how they could earn extra income and potentially retire early through learning how to trade properly too. I also post all of my trades so there isn't any bullshit.

The Scam
The scammer will repeatedly say things like ""Doubling money!"" until a victim comes up to them and trade. The scammer will most likely asks the victim to ""test"" them and the victim will trade a small amount of money to the scammer. The scammer then trades them double the amount, claiming it's a glitch. The victim's greed then is manipulated and trades the scammer a larger amount of cash. The scammer then logs out, or attempts to increase the victim's greed even more.

Often these scammers are trolled by other members of the community. One common troll is to trade over a very small amount of money, then claiming that they gave the wrong amount of coins back. Sometimes players may stand around mocking the way that these scammers operate, except instead say 'Halving Money!'.

Knowing BTC so well like I do, I believe when it breaks out of this wedge, we are going UP. 

Why in the world would an asset that is now more scarce than ever, with more exposure than ever, at all time high hash rate, and the community understands it more than ever, and trusts it more than ever, and people like me are writing songs about it because we like it so much (check out my Bitcoin song by the way, its on Spotify)... why in the world would that type of asset go down? 

So, yeah it's been stuck in a wedge. Big whoop. A little boring and testing on your patience, yes. 

However, when this wedge goes bye bye and it finally starts doing something different .... we are in for a MOTHER FREAKING SHOW!@

we had the VIX sub 27 print with a quick rebound. Yesterday i had called for a print range 27-31, but really didn't expect this little hedging, thus i was expecting VIX to print ~30 or certainly higher than 29 but it didnt hah. Not sure what to make of that but i guess everyone reduced risk yesterday as well!

We lose the lower channel band and 320 means we can expect good support at 318. Although i am confident we will close above 318 institutions could sell in massive waves ahead of ER next week (i doubt this but it's on the table nonetheless).

COVID-19: NAD+ deficiency may predispose the aged, obese and type2 diabetics to mortality through its effect on SIRT1 activity

Every dip has become a buying opportunity despite several institutions taking profit at SPX levels ~2950 & 3200 leaving a lack of market participation in June. 

Institutions are hedged to the teeth through the end of the year and don't care where we land it seems. The biggest tell will be the selling from tech over the next few weeks. I don't imagine ER performance will matter much considering their best stock performance has occurred in a recession.

However, i'm sure the beats and misses from these tech companies will offer good talking points as people try to grasp the justification of these prices due to the lack of fundamentals being displayed in stock performance.

those who grew up in poverty as

The Wharton School was full of

service with BOGUS medical
deferments paid with bribes.

As of right now this line has been successfully tested as a new buyers zone and for this week it is sitting at 3120. This is for now the ballpark bull/bear level that we will be looking at to see if there are any new developments and if the market shows any kind of weakness/strength. 

Sitting where it is now it is well above the current conditions for market going bull however there was some obvious exhaustion in the latter part of last week we must keep in mind.

Facebook has been showing Divergence on RSI since early June.  The divergence between Price action and Momentum has continued to grow for over 6 weeks.  I think the next break of the 1D 21 here will likely lead to a very nice short.  Timing something like this can be very hard.  I do think Facebook has a 10-20% pull back before end of year which will probably lead to a very good buy opportunity.

In order to be profitable trades cannot happen by accident. We always discourage
blindless chasing or going into whatever is hot now. Just because everybody is trading it does not mean that you must as well, because for all you know 90% of those people are losing. Patience pays and bias kills, we covered that already.

Rejection from the top of the channel on wednesday last week has lead to some nice downside.  Today's Price action opened under the 1D 55 tested it and sold off.  This is a pretty bearish sign that Price action was rejected by the 1D 55.  With 1D RSI and stochastic's in a bearish posture I think this could potentially have more downside in its future. 

A retest of the low 90's seems very likely in the next month.

Amazon with a huge bounce off of the 1D 21 last Thursday.  Amazon is up almost 10% since the retest of the 1D 21.  I believe this will likely run into earnings later this week so there is not to much analysis to be done until after earnings.  I am not buying at these prices, but I certainly wouldnt short here either.  I think patience is the best play until something more obvious is available.

SPY finding huge support on the 4 hour 21 and 3193 horizontal as seen in the screen shot.  This is the kind of support you expect to see before the market continues upwards.  As we can see today the market did in-fact continue upwards.  At this point as bullish as the market looks the Earning Reports the next few days are going to decide everything.  At the moment things look extremely bullish even for these prices.

The gaps on BABA these last couple of weeks make for a very interesting chart.  It is interesting that there are big moves after hours, but the trading during the day is a much smaller range.  I don't really have a strong opinion on BABA, but overall it looks strong. I think overtime BABA will come down and test the 230's and that will be a great long term buy opportunity.

Disney was rejected by the 1D 200 (purple line) last week after making a nice run.  Typically a rejection from the 1D 200 is a pretty bearish signal.  Disney did find support on the 1D 21 today, but closed the day under the 118$ horizontal.  With RSI and Stochastic's crossing down high in the range and in a bearish posture this could have some more downside.   If Disney is unable to break up above 118 I could see this down to the 111-114 area in the next couple of weeks.

Similar story to a lot of other big tech stocks.  After a pull back last week to the 1D 21 Paypal had a huge bounce today. This is a very bullish thing to see.  

Stocks are always going to go up some days and down some days, but when a bullish stock goes down you want to see it find support.  This is exactly what Paypal has done at the 1D 21.   As long as Paypal stays above the 1D 21 I am bullish on this stock.

Futures finding support on the 3262 horizontal.  Its amazing because this horizontal hasn't been in play since Jan/ Feb of this year, but clearly the algo's are trading it.

Cisco broke up above the 46 resistance a few weeks ago, but then was sold off.  Only to test the 1D 200 and bounce back above $46.  This 46 horizontal is extremely important as it has been in play for over 20 years.  Yes that is right Cisco has been respecting the $46 area for 20 years.

Twitter playing off of the horizontals beautifully this week.  I missed the short opportunity this morning off of the 38.50 resistance.  If you look at yesterdays analysis you will see that 38.5 was this weeks target and it already hit!  Overall Twitter still looks very strong so if it is able to hold above 36 this will probably be a great buy.
