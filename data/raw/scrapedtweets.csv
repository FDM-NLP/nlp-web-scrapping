Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

We can see that Greenlane Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company‚Äôs stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it.‚Äù

The proposal values MDC common shares at $4.25/share on a fully diluted basis and implies a premium of 263% to MDC‚Äôs closing price of $1.17/share on June 24.

Stagwell would receive 335.5M common shares of MDC.

The combination will strengthen MDC Partners‚Äô balance sheet and credit profile.

Since these markets are such a psychological game, it's important to have many different personalities under observation.. including your own!

I love the ability to follow people because everyone has something different to say, and if you pick just a handful of people and learn their psychology, it can help be yet another tool to help feel out the market and make trade decisions...

Might seem a little ""stalkerish"" but not at all. I just click ""follow"" on people that stand out to me, and before I know it, after reading lots of their posts, I start to develop an idea of the type of trader they are... and I take note of it all on the daily as part of my DD/daily analysis. 

@diagio is my dynamic thunderbird, he's smart and witty.. quick to drop a hot potato, ruthless, and will call you out for being a bad trader.
@risksavage_inthemarket he's my feisty cannabis man, he will bite your head off and wouldn't be surprised if $SPY went to $0 tomorrow.

MP93,/MP93/message/226632146,Bullish,"$SPY Someone just asked me why I keep saying $308. Look no further than the weekly chart. You have a clear ""Bullish Engulfing"" candle and now the price should come back and tap that $308 price imbalance to setup for a move higher next week. Simple as that. Sure they can sell next week's candle off on the back side of the ""bullish engulfing"" which is called a ""breaker block."" However, I think the more likely move is to confirm that the ""bullish engulfing"" is legit and go with what you're seeing rather than taking a contrarian viewpoint. But that said if they do sell next week's candle off then you'd want to watch that psychological $300 level. Period. Bears if they want to go lower they have to cleanly break through $300 again confirming a ""Bearish Engulfing."" Still too much Fed intervention I don't see it happening yet until SPY seeing ATHs.

Bounce off of the 1 hour 21 and continuation into the third hour of trading.  You can see how the current hourly candle wicked down and got bought up quickly.  That speaks to the strength of the buying right now.   The full range has already been played today as of this morning.  A break of 316 going into the weekend would be pretty bullish.

The little guys have already gotten run over for the last 30 years since Reagan and nothing is changing. They have the strength to weather this. That's why biggest caps are doing best as well, they have been preparing 12 years for this.

It is said the number one reason for business failure is undercapitalized, this is false, it's because they don't have the sales, and can't transform to generate the sales.

Yet, now, the U.S. government has racked up $863 billion in debt, in just one month. 
 
For additional perspective, the budget deficit for June 2019 was $8 billion.  Hence, the deficit for June 2020 has increased 101x compared to June of last year.  This, no doubt, is game over spending; desperate actions by a desperate government to keep this sucker from going down. 
 
Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital, for clarification of what‚Äôs at stake: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a risk that the dollar starts to reverse into a significant downtrend because the value of the dollar versus other currencies is greatly affected by the growth in our budget and trade deficit.‚Äù

But I disagree with this on one fact.  The American Radical Aristocratic Left is more racist.  Even worse, they are passive aggressive and manipulative about it.  At least most Chinese will tell you to their face they think anyone other than Chinese is inferior to them and China gonna rule the world.

Global Fascist Left is most racist.  Telling black people/ ""Minorities"" they need special help to succeed is as racist as it gets.  All the while creating modern day plantations of single mothers and desolate atmosphere where kids are manipulated into believing they have no future because of the Republicans that have never had any say on any policies in their cities.

Left has controlled these cities for Decades and in some cases, centuries. Yet some how its #MAGA , Trump and Republicans fault lol.

Should yield curve control go global, it would cement markets‚Äô perception of central banks as the buyers of last resort, boosting risk appetite, lowering volatility and intensifying a broader hunt for yield. While money managers caution that such an environment could fuel reckless investment already stoked by a flood of fiscal and monetary stimulus, they nonetheless see benefits rippling across credit, equities, gold and emerging markets.

‚ÄúIt depends on the form and the price but broadly speaking it‚Äôs the green light to carry on with the QE trade -- buy everything regardless of valuation,‚Äù said James Athey, who manages $3.1 billion at Aberdeen Standard Investments in London.

MP93,/MP93/message/226987309,Bullish,"$SPY Options are such a great way to grow a SMALL (under $25000) trading account. So long as you‚Äôre trading intraday the nearest expiration option or maybe the next to nearest expiration option you have the ability to swing that contract for well over 100%+ / per Day. I want to put up a chart illustrating how at certain times of the day if you entered a particular option and yes lately it has been calls shortly after the 9:30-10:30am dip and ride those calls throughout the mid portion of the cash session you could capture 100%+ gains in a single trading session. That is how you can turn a SMALL account into $25000+ in a relatively short amount of time. Now, personally I have strict rules to my trading in terms of risk/reward, stops, and profit targets. I typically will risk SPY $0.50 or -10% on my option to make 20-40%. So my risk / reward ratios are always 1 : 2 or 1 : 4.

The initial theorem was that this was an accumulation cycle with a retouch on top of the breakout and turns out we were right.

Nothing shows this better than the daily. With a clear breakout from the chop and a retouch of 3105 which was top of the breakout where new demand would have to be for this to keep going, ES looks as bullish as ever. The 3180 level and of course the 3230 above are clear targets however should ES push through I don‚Äôt think either one of those levels have enough selling interest leftover to stop it. On a pullback some obvious levels to watch out for are 3150 area and 3130 area on a pullback. Until 3230 gets taken out this is still a higher low so do keep that in mind as well.

Clearly TRUMP'S fault, but already factored in. Probably good for 200 points on the DJIA tomorrow.  

Meanwhile, if you really support BLM, check out: 1) MLK (the man), and 2) GLYC (trials with 94.5% black representation, 91% institutional ownership, sub $175M market cap, and pipeline including 2 phase 3 drugs... one of which apparently just proved statistical significance).

Another member of the coronavirus task force, Admiral Brett Giroir, added to the Fauci pile-on today when he told NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeet the Press‚Äù that Fauci has not always been correct.

‚ÄúI respect Dr. Fauci a lot, but Dr. Fauci is not 100 percent right and he also doesn‚Äôt necessarily, he admits that, have the whole national interest in mind. He looks at it from a very narrow public health point of view,‚Äù Giroir said.

‚ÄúThe economic implications of the second wave are pretty clear, qualitatively at least. The third quarter recovery will be slower than we previous expected, but we're hoping that some of the deferred spending will be pushed into the fourth quarter rather than abandoned altogether,‚Äù Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note.

‚ÄúMarkets are caught in the middle. We have argued for months that a full recovery depends on three pillars, namely, sustained progress against the virus, the continuance of super-accommodative Fed policy, and consistent support from fiscal policy,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúClearly, the first pillar has crumbled, and the third is now in limbo, with the Senate in recess until July 20. The Fed can't do everything, so we're not surprised that the S&P 500 has been range-bound since late May.‚Äù",2020/07/13,01:30:13

Everyone will outperform a pathetic guidance and Wall Street will cheer it on. When banks lose 30% YTD it will be a massive buying opportunity because they didn‚Äôt lose 50% ....
